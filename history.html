      <h1>The FR-S idea: balance and control</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        The FR-S (and its twin, the BRZ) was built around a simple concept: give drivers a lightweight, rear-wheel-drive coupe that feels precise and playful.
        It is a car that makes handling the main event, not an afterthought.

        <h2>Roots and inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          The spirit of the FR-S connects to older Toyota classics that made driving feel personal.
          When people bring up the AE86, they usually mean one thing: a simple chassis that comes alive when you push it.
          The FR-S carries that same “driver first” energy, updated for a modern era with better safety, better rigidity, and sharper steering feel.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love that the FR-S does not pretend to be something it is not. It is built for control on curvy roads,
          through canyons and downhill drives where precision matters more than raw power.
          It rewards smooth inputs and good habits, and it still leaves headspace for more potential as you build it further.

      <h2>Design that encourages learning</h2>
      <p>
        A lightweight manual car teaches you to be smooth. You learn throttle control, weight transfer, and how your inputs affect grip.
        That is why the FR-S became such a popular platform: it is friendly enough to start with, but deep enough to grow with you.
