      <h1>How I got into cars</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Cars became my favorite form of self-expression because they mix creativity with real skill.
        You can see the personality in the details, and you can feel the effort in the way a build drives.

      <h2>The beginning</h2>
      <p>
        My grandpa helped me buy my first real “love it” car. He wanted it to be something I would actually enjoy, not just something to get from point A to point B.
        We talked about what would make sense as an entry-level sports car, and I kept coming back to the FR-S.
        I did not connect with the Miata, and I liked the FR-S styling and simplicity more.
        I also wanted something that felt reliable and straightforward, instead of chasing a more complicated platform like a WRX.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I had it, it started pulling me into the whole car world. I began going to meets, shows, and events whenever I could.
        The best part is seeing how different everyone’s builds are. Two people can start with the same model and end up with totally different results.
        That craftsmanship and uniqueness is what keeps me coming back.

        <h2>My favorite cars</h2>
        <p class="muted">
          These are the cars that always stop me in my tracks.
          Each one has a presence that feels earned.
        </p>

        <ol class="favorites">
          <li><strong>Nissan Skyline GT-R Hakosuka</strong> (the OG legend vibe)</li>
          <li><strong>Mazda RX-7 FD</strong> (timeless design and rotary personality)</li>
          <li><strong>Lexus LFA</strong> (sound that feels unreal)</li>
          <li><strong>Porsche slantnose</strong> (iconic and unapologetic)</li>

        <h2>Why it matters to me</h2>
        <p>
          Cars push me to create. They give me a reason to learn, save up, plan, and be patient.
          I want a career that can support this passion because it is the hobby where the effort is visible.
          Even when I have other interests, cars are the one that feels like a long-term project I can keep building on.
        </p>
        <p class="micro">
          It is expensive, but it is worth it because it turns curiosity into real progress.
