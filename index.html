          It is not the fastest car on the road, but it is the one that made me fall in love with the process.

        <h2>About my car</h2>
        <p>
          I fell in love with my 2013 Scion FR-S because it feels honest. It is a lightweight manual car that rewards you for paying attention.
          It is not a “power solves everything” kind of build, and that is exactly why it became my favorite teacher.
          Little by little, I learned how to work with my hands, how to plan upgrades, and how to keep improving without rushing the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driving it helped with my anxiety in a way I did not expect. When I am behind the wheel, everything gets simpler.
          You focus on the road, the sound, the clutch, the steering, and the next corner. It gives my brain one job, and that job feels good.
          It is the kind of fun where you do not need huge horsepower, just a balanced chassis, a manual gearbox, and a little bit of “turn off the braincells” energy.
        </p>

          <li><strong>Short shifter</strong> for crisp gear changes</li>
          <li><strong>Cold air intake</strong> for better response and sound</li>

          It already feels sharp and controllable, and it still has headspace for more potential with future modifications.
